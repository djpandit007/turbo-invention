# Section 8: State Persistence

## 107: Volumes

Volume stores the data generated by a pod even after the pod is deleted.
The volume needs storage which can be configured in multiple ways.
We mount the volume once it is created to access it from a container.

## 108: Persistent Volumes

Access Mode defines how a Volume should be mounted on the hosts.
The supported values are `ReadOnlyMany`, `ReadWriteOnce` or `ReadWriteMany` mode.
Persistent Volumes can be configured to be recycled or retained after the associated
claim has been deleted.
If recycled, the data is scrubbed before assigning the volume to other claims.

## 109: Persistent Volume Claims

Once the Persistent Volume Claims are created, Kubernetes binds the Persistent Volumes
to Claims based on the request and properties set on the volume.
Every Persistent Volume Claim is bound to a single Persistent Volume. There is a
1:1 mapping between Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim.

## 114: Storage Classes

Every time an application requires storage we have to manually provision the disk
and then manually create a persistent volume definition file using the same name
as that of the disk created. This is called Static Provisioning of Volumes.

We can define a provisioner that can automatically provision storage and attach
that to pods when a claim is made. That's called Dynamic Provisioning of Volumes.
Storage Classes allow us to dynamically provision volumes.

The Storage Class automatically creates a Persistent Storage so we don't have to.

## Noteworthy Commands

`kubectl get persistentvolume` will show all persistent volumes.

`kubectl exec <pod-name> -- cat <file-path>` will read the file located at
`file-path` within the pod `pod-name`.
