# Section 8: State Persistence

## 107: Volumes

Volume stores the data generated by a pod even after the pod is deleted.
The volume needs storage which can be configured in multiple ways.
We mount the volume once it is created to access it from a container.

## 108: Peristent Volumes

Access Mode defines how a Volume should be mounted on the hosts.
The supported values are `ReadOnlyMany`, `ReadWriteOnce` or `ReadWriteMany` mode.

## Noteworthy Commands

`kubectl get persistentvolume` will show all persistent volumes.
